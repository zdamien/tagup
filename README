python test.py
tests the basic API functionality in the obvious way.
URLs other than create and modify work in a browser too.


value1 was simply described as 'string'.  I'm choosing a length limit of
4096 characters... well, 10 actually, for testing purposes.

'/api/read/:recordId    Read a specific record'
unclear if the : is part of the URL or simply noting a variable field.
I assume the latter.

timestamp is # of milliseconds, but integer or float?  I'll assume
integer, else it could simply have been float and # of seconds instead
of # of milliseconds.


I'm using Django but not Django Rest Framework, and bypassing the
'views' part of Django for pure REST API.  Not sure if this is best
practice but it's what I know at the moment.

Project was said to be about how I code, not how I set up a secure
webserver, so it's Django development server, HTTP, CSRF disabled.

Concurrency: sqlite seems to lock itself on writes, so no explicit
locking code needed for this project.
